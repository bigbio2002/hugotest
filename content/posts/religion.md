I am probably the only Atheist that will tell you that he wishes there was a God, but I do. I wish there was an all-powerful being that would judge us for our behaviors, protect the innocent, and punish the ones who commit evil. But that's not the universe we live in, from what I can see. I honestly envy those who are true believers in their faith, because it gives them an anchor during times of adversity. That is something that I do not have, because I honestly just don't see it.

What I see in the world is chaos without reason. Sure, sometimes good people get rewarded and the wicked get punished. But sometimes good things happen to bad people, and sometimes bad things happen to good people too, through no fault of their own. Being a good person or a bad person has no bearing as to the outcome of our lives. One could make the argument that being a good person who treats people well will prosper because of the positive social connections, but then, people who are manipulative, greedy and abusive can also garner advantages in life by lying, stealing, and using violence to work their way up the ladder. And I would argue that the advantages gained using those methods far outweigh the advantages gained from doing the right thing (that's why crime is still a lucrative venture for some, after all).

In the end, it's not about being a good person or a bad person. It's all about power. The ability to do what you want and take what you want with impunity. An excellent illustration of this concept is First Contact of the European conquistadors and the natives of the Americas. They came. They saw the vast resources that were there for the taking (never mind the natives who already inhabited the continent). Then they raped, looted, and conquered.
