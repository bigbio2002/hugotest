## Introduction

My name is **Harry Weinstein**. I am a 35 year old computer nerd living in Queens, New York. I am originally from Connecticut, but I came to New York City for college and I've lived here ever since. During the early spring of 2020, when the Coronavirus pandemic began, I was living at 40-47 77th St. in Jackson Heights. This is literally around the corner from Elmhurst Hospital, which at one point early on was the "epicenter of the pandemic". During this same period, I began seeing a cute guy named **Kin Omambing**, and we grew closer together during this period of turmoil. I married him later that same year, and I intend to stay by his side, as he stood by mine, for the rest of my life, *until death do us part*.

Kin is the love of my life and the ultimate reason for why I am writing here today. I am white, and I have been fortunate enough to enjoy the privilege of being so, thanks to the luck of the birth lottery. I have lived a pretty good life thus far, but as I've come to be intimately aware, not nearly everybody on this planet is so lucky. My husband Kin is Filipino, and while he seems to have had a decent upbringing, he has fallen into a situation over the past decade wherein he has been getting exploited and abused, and quite horribly so. (Because what better demographic to exploit than poor, brown-skinned third-worlders who are looking for a life-changing opportunity? It changed his life, all right, and not for the better...) He is an innocent person with a good heart, who did nothing wrong, who got trapped in a horrible situation on account of bad luck, naivette, and the will of those who desire to exploit him. Never, ever forget to lay the blame where it belongs: on the abusers, not the victim.

I have dedicated the remainder of my life to trying to make his better. Unfortunately, after 4 years of trying, I am coming to the conclusion that I am likely not going to succeed, which is very disheartening. But, as long as both of us are alive, I need to keep trying for his sake. He never asked me for help, but when I discovered what was going on with him, I've had both the privilege and the balls to stand up, speak out, and say, "Hey! That what you're doing there is wrong!" That's a big part of the reason why I asked him to marry me: because I wanted to give him the status of being my husband, so I can stand up for him and demand his rights and what he is entitled to, where he is unable to do so himself. What, exactly, has he been going through, you ask? Here's where things start to get interesting...

Some of the things that I will write here may sound unbelievable at first. But I ask that you please hold your judgment and read through all I have to say, instead of outright dismissing me as crazy. And most of all, if something I say doesn't make sense to you, **I welcome all questions**, because I wish to convince you of the veracity of all I have to say:

> Everything I am to tell you here is literally true to the best of my knowledge, based upon observations that I have personally made first-hand, leading to conclusions deduced using my own logic and rationality; my theories are not based upon anonymous writings that I read somewhere on the dark web.

> I did not jump to these conclusions off the bat; it took me months and months of 24/7 proximity to him during the height of COVID before I finally figured out what was going on with him.

> I am not crazy.

> I am not a liar.

> I am not making shit up for attention.

> I am not somehow mistaken.

> I have no ulterior motive.

> I have no concern for what I may stand to gain or lose by doing this.

> My only vested interest is improving my husband's situation and giving him a better life, so that we may both have a long, happy one to share together.

My husband was used as a guinea pig for the development of a Neuralink-like device I dub the "supersoldier chip", whose utility is to override the motor control of the host's body, enabling them to be physically controlled like a puppet. This chip was developed by the government in secret, without regard to the well-being of the subject. The primary method used to develop the motor control override capabilities is by inflicting pain on the subject, the preferred method chosen being **rape**.

> Because what better way to refine your motor control over a host's body, while learning to counter undesired motor inputs from the host (such as from the pain reflex), than to have your test subject raped painfully in the ass over, and over, and over...?

And I assure you from first-hand experience witnessing the capabilities of this chip, their motor control is quite refined indeed.

If you doubt that this kind of technology exists, I implore you to do the following:

> Just imagine the kinds of leaps and bounds in progress one could make in neuroscience if one were to completely disregard things such as Institutional Review Boards, medical ethics, or the wellbeing of the subject altogether and just proceed gung-ho on the science. Just imagine...

Because this is *exactly* what has transpired in the development of this abomination! For all that my husband has suffered through, it doesn't take much imagination to extrapolate a bit further and realize that there have been many more unknown individuals who have been hurt in ways much, much worse, and who will never have any justice, restitution, or even hope. After all, if you're doing experimental, cutting-edge brain surgery willy-nilly, you're bound to make a few... mistakes. See the scandal with the Neuralink test monkeys to get an idea of the nightmarish crimes that have surely transpired to untold numbers of human beings for the sake of this godforsaken chip.

But as long as I am alive and free, there is still hope for Kin... but it's a long shot. At this point in the game, I do not foresee success in my quest. I've tried everything I could think of, to no avail, and nothing short of the *Powers that Be* willingly deciding to let him go free is going to succeed; certainly not doing so by force or by trying to outsmart them. So here, I post my plight to the world, and to his handlers at the **N.S.A.**, the *Powers that Be* themselves, in the hope that someone, somewhere can do something to help. **I am not in this for me, I am in this for Kin**, so if you can, please **Help Me Help Kin**, and spread the word of what I have to say here to as many others as you can. After all, how can a problem be solved if nobody knows it even exists?

Thank you for reading and stay tuned for more. Feel free to contact me at *harry[at]openlettertonsa.com* if you have any questions, comments, or hopefully any advice or help to offer. And lastly, do good to your fellow human. Just trust me on that one.
