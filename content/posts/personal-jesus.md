title: Personal Jesus

I've made an interesting observation recently. Many people will pay lip service to the ideal that we should be nice to people, give to charity, help the less fortunate, etc., but when push comes to shove, they just don't have the drive to do it. So why pay lip service then, for piety? No. People embrace this imaginary idea of the world caring about them, because deep down inside, they are hoping that if they're ever in some kind of dire situation, that someone will be there to swoop in and rescue them. Almost like a personal Jesus. I mean who wouldn't want to be saved when one is facing certain doom? But here's the kicker: they expect and hope that somebody would come for them in their moment of need, but would they ever go out and do the same for another person if they had the opportunity in front of them? You tell me what you think about that one.

Everybody wants to be saved, but few willing to risk their neck and do the saving. This is something that I am proud of myself for. It seems as if I and I alone stood up for a victim of their projection and tried to speak out about the abuses and atrocities committed in the name of their black project. It does not look like I will ultimately succeed in my quest, but at least I tried where nobody else would; I sized the opportunity to try and make a difference in his life, maybe even a difference in the world, and I did my best to run with it. But the Powers that Be and this new technology of theirs are far too powerful. Looking back, I don't think I ever stood a chancee. But at least I tried, and that's something that I can die at peace with.
